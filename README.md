## Introduction

Finding a nested object with a specific attribute name can be a challenging task, especially when dealing with complex object hierarchies. The `findNestedObjectWithAttribute` function provides a simple solution to this problem. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm to traverse through the object and locate the nested object with the desired attribute.

## Usage

To use the `findNestedObjectWithAttribute` function, follow these steps:

1. Include the function code in your JavaScript file or project.
2. Call the function with the object to search within and the attribute name as parameters.
3. The function will return an object containing the path and value of the attribute if found, or `null` if not found.
